        "# OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is oop?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradiqm based on the concept of \"objects\" which are instance of classes. it organizes software design around data(objects) rather than functions and logic. OOP is widely used in modern programming languages like python and java\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in oop\n",
        "- A class in oop is a blueprint or template for creating objects. it defines the properties (attributes) and behaviours (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. what is a object in oop\n",
        "- an object in oop is an instance of a class. it is a real world entity which has attributes(data) and methods (behaviour) defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "- abstraction and encapsulation are both fundatamental concepts in oop, but they serve different purposes\n",
        "Abstraction hides complex implementation details and showing only necessary features to the users.\n",
        "Encapsulation restricts direct access to certain details of an object and allowing controlled access through method\n",
        "\n",
        "5. what are dunder methods in python\n",
        "- dunder (double underscore) methods, also called magic method or special method, are predefined methods in python that starts and ends with double underscores. these methods allow you to define how objects of a class behave with built in operations like addition, comparison, string representation etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. explain the concept of inheritance in object\n",
        "- inheritance is a fundamental oop concept that allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or super class). it promotes code reuse, modularity and extensibility by enabling new classes to built upon existing ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. what is polymorphism in oop\n",
        "- it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. it enables the same method name or operator to have different behaviours depending upon the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. how is encapsulation achieved in python\n",
        "- it is the process of restricting direct access to an object data and methods while allowing controlled access through defined method. this ensures data security, intergrity, modularity in an oop.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. what is a constructor in python\n",
        "- it is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created. the constructor method is __init__() which is automatically called when a new object of a class in instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. what are class and static methods in python\n",
        "- these methods are special types of methods that belong to a class rather than a instance. they are defined using decorators and serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. what is method overloading in  python\n",
        "- it is a concept in oop where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters. (i.e different arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. what is method overriding in oop\n",
        "- it is a concept in oop where a childclass redines a method from its parent class. this allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. what is a property decorator in python\n",
        "- it is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for encapsulating class attributes. it allows us to access methods like attributes, providing, controlled access to instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. why is polymorphism important in python\n",
        "- it the ability of different objects to be treated as instance of the same class. it allows for code reusability, flexability and maintainabilty.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. what is an abstract class\n",
        "- it is a class that cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be used. it serves as a blueprint for other classes and typically contain abstract method , which are methods that must be implemented by subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. what are the advantages of oop\n",
        "- inheritance, data hiding, flexabilty, hiding complexity, scalability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. what is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "- class variable define inside the class but outside any method, shared among all instance of the class, changing the class variable affects all instances (unless overridden).\n",
        "instance variable defined inside the contructor __init__() using self, unique for each insatnce of the class. changing the instance variable only affects that specific object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. what is multiple inheritance in python\n",
        "- it is a feature in python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. this allows a child class to access attributes and methods from multiple parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. explain the purpose of __str__, __repr__ in python\n",
        "- both are dunder methods that define a object of a class are represented as string. they are used to provide meaningful string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. what is the significance of the super() function in python\n",
        "- the super() function in python is used to call a method from the parent(superclass) in a child class. it is primarily used in inheritance to access parent class method/constructor, avoid code duplication, support multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. what is the significance of the __del__ method\n",
        "- it is a destructor method that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. it allows you to release resources like files, network connection, or memory before an object is removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. what is the difference between static method an class method\n",
        "- static method does not requires self or cls, acts like a regular function in a class, cannot modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "class method takes cls as the first parameter instead of self, can modify class variables, used when a method needs access to class level attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "23. how does polymorphism works with inheritance\n",
        "- polymorphism is often used with inheritance, where a child class overrides a method from the parent class to provide its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. what is method chaining\n",
        "- it is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line. it improves code readibility and reduces temporary variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. what is the purpose of __call__\n",
        "- it allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "it makes object callable just like function.\n",
        "used in function like classes, decorator, and callbacks\n",
